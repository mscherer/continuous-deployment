# Deploying a development environment

## Prequisites
* An OCP 4.x Development cluster
* Must have cluster admin (not kube:admin)

## Instructions

Create the project `aicoe-argocd-dev` and `argocd-test`. The latter will be used
for deploying a dev application via ArgoCD.

```bash
oc new-project argocd-test
oc new-project aicoe-argocd-dev
```

### Deploy ArgoCD
```bash
git clone git@github.com:operate-first/continuous-deployment.git
cd continuous-deployment

# Deploy Cluster objects
kustomize build manifests/crds --enable_alpha_plugins | oc apply -f -

# Deploy Non Cluster objects
kustomize build manifests/overlays/dev --enable_alpha_plugins | oc apply -f -
```

## Configure Auth
Once deployed, there are some additional configurations, run this script:
```bash
examples/configure_development.sh
```
The script needs to be run under a user with the cluster admin role, but not with `kube:admin`.

Feel free to look inside the script for detailed comments on what configurations are applied.

## Cleanup
Run the following commands to clean up your environment.

```
kustomize build manifests/overlays/dev --enable_alpha_plugins | oc delete -f -
kustomize build manifests/crds --enable_alpha_plugins | oc delete -f -
oc delete group dev-group
oc delete project argocd-test
oc delete project aicoe-argocd-dev
```
